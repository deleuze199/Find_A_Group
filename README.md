# Find A Group
This program is made for a group of people (such as a school) to organize and inform others about meeting times, places and roles a club/group. Members of Find A Group can view the meeting times, places and roles of the club/group they have joined.

-   **Goals**  (high level intended outcomes; for software)
	- Allow all users to register with a UID and password. When registering the users will be split into two classifications: Member and Staff. The users will also be able to enter the date at witch they will stop needing the program. When this date is reached it will remove the users information from the database.

	    - join clubs/groups they are interested in
	    - view the club's/group's meeting times, places and roles that they have joined
	    - request roles for club's/group's they have joined
    -   Allow a staff member to be able to:
	    - join clubs/groups they are interested in
	    - view and edit the club's/group's meeting times and places that they have joined
	    - view, create, and accept the club's/group's roles that they have joined

-   **Design**
